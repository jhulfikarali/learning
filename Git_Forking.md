# GitHub Forking

_forking_ is a process of having parallel distributed versioning system for yourselves. 

This allows all your work to be personal to you (to some extend ;)) but allows others to review work and encourages to discuss to bring new feature.

## How do we fork?

Simple, just click **Fork** icon that you see on the rightmost top corner below your profile links (in other words, below your photo link).

Just click and wait for the magic. It will create a fork for you!!! Once created you will see few things as listed below:

1. Link to the repository is changed as follows:
   https://github.com/**actual_repository**/learning.git to https://github.com/**your_username**/learning.git
2. Left top corner, will show your forked and master repository URLs.

Are these important? No, not really but you should know where you are looking your code for future references.
