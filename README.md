> No fancy buzzwords to scare you. GitHub is distributed versioning system. What it means is, it versions your files and releases in a distributed way. _Distributed_ in GitHub is simple, when you fork (fancy word for your own branch), you download not just code but all the history of Repository whereas most versioning system are centralized to one system and one stop failure.
