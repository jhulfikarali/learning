# GitHub Introduction

No fancy buzzwords to scare you! GitHub is a _distributed versioning system_. What it means is, **it versions your files and releases in a distributed way**. _Distributed_ in GitHub is simple, when you fork (fancy word for your own branch), you download not just code but all the history of Repository whereas most versioning system are centralized to one system and one stop failure.

More than everything, what excite me most is, its kinda **chatting system** that allows developers to discuss about features and move further on.

I said no scaring without buzzword, isn't? I am sorry but we must know & talk in the following GitHub vocabulary, so everyone else in the world understands it. Cool and you are with me, right?

## GitHub basics

### _master_ branch

Source code will and must be under _master_ branch which is default branch for your code & deployments.

### _feature_ branch

_feature_ branches are created by individuals for any new work/feature.

### pr - Pull Request

Upon completing the work in _feature_ branch, you create PR (Pull Request). Based on project repository setup, PR can be merged or reviewed for further discussions.

## Cloning and Forking

### cloning

_Cloning_ is a process of getting GitHub repository code and meta data into your local folder. 

### fork
_fork_ is a process of having parallel copy of the repository. 

Please note that _fork_ is repository level and _feature_ is branch level as both are cloning kind.

That's it for basics, please follow below link for how to do forking, cloning and feature construction.
